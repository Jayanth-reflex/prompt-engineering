**Description:**
"Context engineering is the delicate art and science of filling the context window with just the right information for the next step." — Andrej Karpathy

A frontier, first-principles handbook inspired by Karpathy and 3Blue1Brown for moving beyond prompt engineering to the wider discipline of context design, orchestration, and optimization.

**Context:**
Context engineering is an emerging discipline that focuses on the design, orchestration, and optimization of the information provided to large language models (LLMs) and other AI systems. Rather than just crafting prompts, context engineering considers the entire context window—what information is included, how it is structured, and how it evolves over time—to maximize model performance and reliability.

This practical, first-principles handbook is inspired by the work of Andrej Karpathy and 3Blue1Brown, and is informed by research from leading conferences (ICML, IBM, NeurIPS, OHBM, and more). It aims to provide actionable guidance for practitioners who want to move beyond prompt engineering and master the broader art of context design.

**Key Concepts:**
- Context window management: Deciding what information to include for each model invocation
- Context orchestration: Dynamically updating and structuring context as tasks evolve
- Optimization: Balancing relevance, recency, and completeness for best model outcomes

**Philosophy:**
- Context is not just a prompt; it is the sum of all information available to the model at inference time
- Effective context engineering can unlock new capabilities and reliability in LLM-powered systems
- The field is rapidly evolving, with new research and best practices emerging from both academia and industry

**Status:**
- Ongoing handbook and research project (star the repo to follow progress)
- Community contributions and feedback are welcome
