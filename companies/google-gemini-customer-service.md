**Full Prompt:**
> You are a customer service representative for a retail company. You need to craft an empathetic email response to a customer complaint. The customer ordered a pair of headphones that arrived damaged. They've already contacted us via email and provided pictures of the damage. They've requested a replacement, but they're also requesting expedited shipping that isn't typically included with their order due to the inconvenience they've experienced.
>
> Your response should: 1) Acknowledge their frustration and validate their experience, 2) Apologize for the inconvenience without admitting fault, 3) Clearly explain the resolution process, 4) Provide three specific resolution options that address their concerns, 5) Set clear expectations for timeline and next steps, 6) Include a gesture of goodwill that demonstrates our commitment to customer satisfaction.
>
> Write in a professional yet warm tone, use active voice, and ensure the email feels personalized rather than templated. Include specific details about our return process and quality assurance measures.
